## Gameplay

The rules for the original Quoridor game can be found [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/quoridor/game-rules.php). Essentially you are in control of a pawn and you want to reach the other side of the board from where you start. Your opponent is trying to do the same and you are both given walls to slow down each other's progress. The key word here is slow downâ€”one path must always exist for each player to reach their respective goal. 

Here is Quoridor3d, things are much the same but now in addition to the board's rows and columns, there are layers. More dimensions, more walls, more fun.

## Controls
* Standard **WASD** + **mouse** controls to move around the play space
* When it's your turn you can press **C** to change cursor type
* The cursor types are for pawn movement or wall placement
* **E** and **Q** move the cursor up and down layers of the play space
* When you're placing a wall, press **R** to change its orientation
* Use **Arrow Keys** to move cursor. Note that directions are independent of camera's view direction

## Play
